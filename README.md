# TwoTestCharacteristics
Code for taking results of two diagnostic tests and using that to infer the diagnostic characteristics of the first test. Also possible to infer other characteristics as well. Interval inputs can be used to calculate with incomplete information, and outputs are functions for a consistent multi-dimensional possibility structure, or alpha cuts can be taken to return marginal intervals of confidence sets.
